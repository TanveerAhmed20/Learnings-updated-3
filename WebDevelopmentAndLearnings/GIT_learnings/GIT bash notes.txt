working with SSH keys  : 

SSH keys are necessary to connect with the github server

There are two types of ssh keys , one is public and one is private: 

public key is denoted by file_name.pub and privatekey is denoted by file_name

* To check is SSH key was already created : 

open git bash 

ls -al ~/.ssh   :::: this will list all the files realted to .ssh
 

NOte : If you don't have a supported public and private key pair, 
or don't wish to use any that are available,
generate a new SSH key.


If no ssh key was found we generate a new key using : 

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "tanveer.ahmed@brillio.com"

This above code will promt a  messasge to enter file name : 
enter the name for the ssh key : example : testkey

You will be asked to input a pass phrase , ignore this for now .



two files will be generated after the process of generation is done : 

testkey.pub and testkey 


You put the public key in new ssh key in settings of the github


The private key must be inserted in the ssh-agent via git-bash cli

steps for ssh private key : 

eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
